List established for the book chapter:

Daniel Vaulot, Gust Bilcke, Peter Chaerle, Angela Falcatiore, Priscillia Gourvil, Michael W. Lomas, Ian Probert, Wim Vyverman. Culturing Diatoms. In _Diatom Photosynthesis: From Primary Production to High Value Molecules_. Edited by Johannes Goessling, Johann Lavaud and João Serôdio, published by Wiley-Scrivener. 

We are deeply indebted to all the curators of algal culture collections that contributed listings of diatom strains in their holdings.
